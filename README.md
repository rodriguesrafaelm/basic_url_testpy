# basic_url_testpy

**Learning python.**

I'm a student using this to learn git and python, this is my first public upload.
Basically, let's you check if a website is available or not. 
Just checks if there is "http://" or "https://" before link and then uses urllib to open url. 
Also verifies if there is ".com" on link. (Not working with ".net" or anything other than ".com" yet.) 
If it's reacheable returns Available else Unavailable.

Feel free to send me projects or anything you think would help me learning python or git.
