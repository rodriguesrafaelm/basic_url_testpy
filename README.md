# Learning python.

I'm a student using this to learn git and python, this is my first public upload.
Basically checks if a website is available or not.</br>
Just checks if there is "http://" or "https://" before link and then uses urllib to open url.</br>
Also verifies if there is ".com" on link. (Not working with ".net" or anything other than ".com" yet.)</br>
If it's reacheable returns Available else Unavailable.

Feel free to send me projects or anything you think would help me learning python or git.
